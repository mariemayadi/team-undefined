Our Idea

Letâ€™s face it, in this day and age you are busy. Work, school, family, friends - everybody pulls you in so many different directions and and before you know it your schedule is a confusing mess. Undefined hopes to connect you with your schedule in a brand new way.

We intend to create a system where people can enter any commitment they know of, and then calculate their free time so they can plan their social lives. They can share these if they want with their friends and ultimately have all their free time laid out with the click of a mouse.
